//*      This release of IND$FILE uses external code page load      *   FILE 607
//*      modules.                                                   *   FILE 607

//*      The default code page module is CDPG1047 and is            *   FILE 607
//*      included as a load module with the IND$FILE loadlib.  In   *   FILE 607
//*      this archive you will find the assembler source CDPG1047   *   FILE 607
//*      which is a job with the source suppied.                    *   FILE 607

//*      Other code pages can be developed by cloning the           *   FILE 607
//*      CDPG1047 source to create other code page load modules.    *   FILE 607
//*      These can then be loaded by IND$FILE by supplying          *   FILE 607
//*      additional parms for the file transfer.                    *   FILE 607
//*                                                                 *   FILE 607
//*      IND$FILE GET host.file.name ASCII CRLF CODEPAGE CDPG1047   *   FILE 607
//*         or                                                      *   FILE 607

//*      If the transfer request does not include the ASCII         *   FILE 607
//*      parameter, then no external code page module will be       *   FILE 607
//*      loaded as binary transfers don't use translation           *   FILE 607
